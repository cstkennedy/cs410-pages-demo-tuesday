# Assignment 1 Review


Assignment 1 was due last Friday (11:59pm EDT 15 September)

I have posted a recorded Assignment 1 review. The review can be accessed at
<https://www.cs.odu.edu/~tkennedy/cs330/latest/Postmortems/review_inventory_llist/>.

Take a few minutes to read through the review page, particularly Section 2 and
Section 3. The recording is listed at the bottom of the page.

# Assignment 2

Assignment 2 is due next week (on 8 February). Make sure that you working on:

  - finishing Review-02 (Well Defined Interfaces)
  - finishing Review-03 (Separation of Concerns)
  - re-reading [Loops & Iterators](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~tkennedy/cs330/latest/Public/designDiscussionIterators/)


## Hints

If you have started Assignment 2... you have definitely noticed the
similarities to Assignment 1. The core logic is the same (e.g., sequential
search). The difference comes from the fact that we are writing data structure
agonistic code with iterators (i.e., working with iterators instead of a
specific data structure).

You will find that Inventory has an updated set of data members...

  - `slots` is still present as the maximum size

  - `occupied` is gone and replaced with a `utilizedSlots()` method

  - `head` and `tail` are gone and replaced with `allItemStacks`


The `addItemStackNoCheck` method is now a one-liner...

```cpp
    allItemStacks.push_back(/*????*/); // The commented out ???? is a placeholder
```

The `findMatchingItemStackIterator` method can be adapted from the Assignment 1
`findMatchingItemStackNode` method...

```cpp
{
    Node* it = this->head;
    while (it != nullptr) {
        if (it->data == itemStack) {
            return it;
        }

        it = it->next;
    }

    return nullptr;
}
```

Let us start with a mapping from `Node*` to `Inventory::iterator`...

| **Piece**      | **Linked List**         | **Iterator**                             |
| :--            | :--                     | :--                                      |
| Initialization | `Node* it = this->head` | `Inventory::iterator it = this->begin()` |
| Bound Check    | `it != nullptr `        | `it != this->end()`                      |
| Dereference    | `it->data`              | `*it`                                    |
| Increment      | `it = it->next`         | `it++` or `++it`                         |
| Sentinel Value | `nullptr`               | `this->end()`                            |

There is a **one-to-one** correspondence between the loops! We can now write
all other loops in the program! We just need to keep in mind that the...

  - Copy Constructor needs const-ness (i.e., a `const_iterator`)
  - display method needs const-ness (i.e., a `const_iterator`)

if `while` loops are used. *Keep in mind that a range-based (for-each) loop can
be used for both of these functions.*


# Email

I am working on catching up on email. If you sent me an email after 5:00pm
Thursday... expect a response by midday Wednesday.
